# 👋 Hi, I'm Hade Bayaa

I hail from Akko and was raised by an electrical engineer father who consistently sought my assistance in addressing diverse challenges. 
This early exposure cultivated a proclivity for problem-solving, eventually transforming it into a cultivated skill. 
At the age of 10, I made the decision to delve into the realm of software engineering.

As I matured, the need for financial independence prompted me to explore various professional domains, allowing me to discover my identity and refine my personal attributes. 
This journey led me to enroll in the Software Engineering BSc program at Shenkar College. During my second year, I assumed the role of an academic tutor, guiding first-grade students in their initial foray into coding, 
with a particular emphasis on the intricacies of the C programming language.

Presently, 
having completed my second year, I eagerly anticipate embarking on my third year.
where I envisage a new chapter filled with enriching experiences and an abundance of coding challenges to overcome.
